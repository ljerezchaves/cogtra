### CogTRA -- Cognitive Transmission Rate Adaptation for OpenWrt

This project comprises the implementation of the Cognitive Transmission Rate Adaptation (CogTRA) into Linux Kernel MAC802.11 layer for the OpenWRT Linux distribution.

At wiki pages there are several tutorials concerning compilation and installation of this mechanism into embedded devices.

Currently we cannot provide support for the code available here. More information about this cognitive mechanism, including related publications, can be found at http://www.lrc.ic.unicamp.br/cogprot/
